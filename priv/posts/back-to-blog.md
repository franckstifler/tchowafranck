After some long months of absence, I'm back on writing. I've been very busy working on my dissertation. I've had the opportunity to explore some A.I(Artificial Intelligence) and NLP(Natural Language Processing). I worked with Python(new language to me), during this project and was amazed of the facility to get up and running with.

AI is all about giving to computers/machines intelligence. Intelligence itself is spread in various cognitive domains, and can be based on facts or some acquired data. Providing machines intelligence can be done by the computer learning from data (machine learning), identifying items (vision, recognition)... helping the computers/machines to be able to solve problems, take decisions, plan, speak, translate...

The applications of AI are myriad, detection of diseases like cancer, translating softwares as Google translate, recommendations engines as Netflix, Google or Amazon, facial recognition...

During my research I focused more on Natural Language Processing. I will share with you my findings and maybe my experience with Python programming language.

Stay tuned!
